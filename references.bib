	title = {{GLocal}: A Hybrid Approach to the Multi-Agent Mission Re-Planning Problem},
	abstract = {Multi-robot systems can be prone to failures during plan execution, depending on the harshness of the environment they are deployed in. As a consequence, initially devised plans may no longer be feasible, and a re-planning process needs to take place to re-allocate any pending tasks. Two main approaches emerge as possible solutions, a global re-planning technique using a centralized planner that will redo the task allocation with the updated world state information, or a decentralized approach that will focus on the local plan reparation, i.e., the re-allocation of those tasks initially assigned to the failed robots. The former approach produces an overall better solution, while the latter is less computationally expensive. The goal of this paper is to exploit the beneﬁts of both approaches, while minimizing their drawbacks. To this end, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a centralized planner with decentralized multi-agent planning. In case of an agent failure, the local plan reparation algorithm tries to repair the plan through agent negotiation. If it fails to re-allocate all of the pending tasks, the global replanning algorithm is invoked, which re-allocates all unﬁnished tasks from all agents. The hybrid approach was compared to planner approach, and it was shown that it improves on the makespan of a mission in presence of different numbers of failures, as a consequence of the local plan reparation algorithm.},

There has been a lot of work on the exchanges between the areas of automated planning and model checking, based on the observation that a model-checking problem can be cast as a planning problem and vice-versa. The motivation for this seminar was to increase the synergy between the two research communities, and explore recent progress in the two areas in terms of techniques, tools and formalisms for describing planning and veriﬁcation problems. The main outcomes were a greater common understanding of planning and modelchecking issues and challenges, and greater appreciation of the crosswover between the modelling languages and methods. Diﬀerent application domains were also explored, where planning and model-checking can be eﬀectively integrated.},

Recent work on generating plans for partially observable domains has advocated for online planning, claiming that offline plans are often too large to generate. Here we push the envelope on this challenging problem, proposing a technique for generating conditional (aka contingent) plans offline. The key to our planner's success is the reliance on state-of-the-art techniques for fully observable non-deterministic ({FOND}) planning. In particular, we use an existing compilation for converting a planning problem under partial observability and sensing to a {FOND} planning problem. With a modified {FOND} planner in hand, we are able to scale beyond previous techniques for generating conditional plans with solutions that are orders of magnitude smaller than previously possible in some domains.},

From the conceptual point of view, different notions of planning problems can be devised: for instance, a plan might either guarantee goal achievement, or just have some chances of success. From the practical point of view, the problem is to devise algorithms that can effectively deal with large state spaces. In this paper, we tackle planning in nondeterministic domains by addressing conceptual and practical problems. We formally characterize different planning problems, where solutions have a chance of success (“weak planning”), are guaranteed to achieve the goal (“strong planning”), or achieve the goal with iterative trial-and-error strategies (“strong cyclic planning”). In strong cyclic planning, all the executions associated with the solution plan always have a possibility of terminating and, when they do, they are guaranteed to achieve the goal. We present planning algorithms for these problem classes, and prove that they are correct and complete. We implement the algorithms in the mbp planner by using symbolic model checking techniques. We show that our approach is practical with an extensive experimental evaluation: mbp compares positively with state-of-the-art planners, both in terms of expressiveness and in terms of performance.},

              This study aims to synthesize the current literature and present a definition of future smart banking services known as “metaverse banking” as well as to discuss its future potential.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper proposes a suitable definition for metaverse banking that includes the important elements of metaverse banking and sheds light on its impending potential from distinct aspects.
            
            
              Findings
              Metaverse banking is a banking channel actualized through the integration of metaverse and online banking services, enabled by a mix of numerous advanced technologies, that provides customers with synchronous banking services accompanied with 3D experiences in a virtual world. There is a high likelihood in the future that metaverse banking is able to be marketed intensively yet effectively, and incur progressive demands, as well as progress significantly in terms of development.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study assists bank managers in understanding metaverse banking better and simultaneously makes them realize the metaverse banking’ growth opportunity which can be pursued.
            
            
              Originality/value
              To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a definition for metaverse banking and expound on the upcoming potential of metaverse banking. There is a lack of related literature because this concept is relatively new. This study assists in enriching the concept and providing future research directions.},

Spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) is a widely used learning mechanism inspired by biology which updates the synaptic weight as a function of the temporal correlation between pre- and post-synaptic spikes.

	title = {The Power of Waiting in Social Laws},
	abstract = {Agents operating in the same environment as other agents could interfere with each other. One approach for coordination in such multi-agent systems is instituting a social law, which restricts possible behaviors of the agents. A social law which ensures that each agent is able to achieve its goal, regardless of what the other agents do, is called robust. Recent work has shown how to verify that a given social law, encoded in a {MA}-{STRIPS} formalism is robust, by compilation to classical planning. That work also introduced the notion of waitfor preconditions, which tell the agent to check if these preconditions hold before executing its next action. In this paper, we show that the waitfor mechanism strictly adds power to social laws. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst show that, without any waitfor preconditions, a social law is robust iff there is no possible harmful interaction between the agents, and thus the {MA}-{STRIPS} problem can be decomposed into independent individual problems for each agent. Second, we show there exist multi-agent problems which are not decomposable, and therefore have no robust social law without waitfor preconditions, which do have a robust social law using waitfor. Finally, we prove that marking preconditions as waitfor preconditions never hurts the robustness of a multi-agent problem.},

To this end, this work aims to address three challenges: (i) complex visual observations, (ii) partial observability of local visual sensing, and (iii) multimodal robot behaviors conditioned on both the local environment and the global navigation objective. We propose to train a neural network ({NN}) controller for local navigation via imitation learning. To tackle complex visual observations, we extract multi-scale spatial representations through {CNNs}. To tackle partial observability, we aggregate multi-scale spatial information over time and encode it in {LSTMs}. To learn multimodal behaviors, we use a separate memory module for each behavior mode. Importantly, we integrate the multiple neural network modules into a unified controller that achieves robust performance for visual navigation in complex, partially observable environments. We implemented the controller on the quadrupedal Spot robot and evaluated it on three challenging tasks: adversarial pedestrian avoidance, blind-spot obstacle avoidance, and elevator riding. The experiments show that the proposed {NN} architecture significantly improves navigation performance.},

We find that if the standard nonlinearity is stronger than the pointwise one, then ground states exist for small mass only. On the contrary, if the pointwise nonlinearity prevails, then ground states exist for large mass only. All ground states are radial, in the sense that their restriction to each half-line is always the same function, and coincides with a soliton tail. Finally, if the two nonlinearities are of the same size, then the existence of ground states is insensitive to the value of the mass, and holds only on graphs with a small number of half-lines. Furthermore, we establish the orbital stability of the branch of radial stationary states to which the ground states belong, also in the mass regimes in which there is no ground state.},

Furthermore, cylindrical silicon nanowires (Cy-{SiNWs}) are regarded as promising candidates for a new generation of {TFSCs}. On this basis, many new nanostructures derived from conventional Cy-{SiNWs} have been studied extensively, but most of these structures require high manufacturing accuracy because of their complex morphology. In this paper, an ingenious design of clustered silicon nanowires (Cl-{SiNWs}) is introduced, whose cross section is similar to the flower shape and consists of four arcs with the same radius. Hence, it requires lower manufacturing difficulty compared with nanostructures with curvature variation of the cross-section profile (i.e., elliptic shape, crescent shape, etc.). In this study, the optical and electrical characterizations are numerically investigated using the finite-difference time-domain method. The numerical simulation shows that the optimized Cl-{SiNWs} achieve an optical ultimate efficiency (ηul) and circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.66\% and 27.54mA/cm2, respectively, with an enhancement of 7.3\% over conventional Cy-{SiNWs}. Further, the ηul and Jsc improve to 42.20\% and 34.53mA/cm2 by adding the silicon substrate and silver backreflector. More importantly, the ηul of Cl-{SiNWs} always obtained a higher value than Cy-{SiNWs} at a recommended diameter range of 360–560 nm. Therefore, the suggested Cl-{SiNWs} have exhibited tremendous potential for the future development of low-cost and highly efficient solar cells.},

Recent successful approaches translate the partially observable contingent problem into a non-deterministic fully observable problem, and then use a planner for non-deterministic planning. However, the translation may become very large, encumbering the task of the non-deterministic planner. We suggest a different approach—using an online contingent solver repeatedly to construct a plan tree. We execute the plan returned by the online solver until the next observation action, and then branch on the possible observed values, and replan for every branch independently. In many cases a plan tree can have an exponential width in the number of state variables, but the tree may have a structure that allows us to compactly represent it using a directed graph. We suggest a mechanism for tailoring such a graph that reduces both the computational effort and the storage space. Our method also handles non-deterministic domains, by identifying cycles in the plans. We present a set of experiments, showing our approach to scale better than state-of-the-art offline planners.},

These laser attacks, however, are challenging to perform, requiring precise aiming and accuracy. Our research exposes a new threat in the form of Intentional Electro-Magnetic-Interference ({IEMI}), which affects the time-of-flight ({TOF}) circuits that make up modern {LiDARs}. We show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to force the {AV} Perception system to misdetect, misclassify objects, and perceive non-existent obstacles. We evaluate the vulnerability in three {AV} perception modules ({PointPillars}, {PointRCNN}, and Apollo) and show how the classification rate drops below 50\%. We also analyze the impact of the {IEMI} injection on two fusion models ({AVOD} and Frustum-{ConvNet}) and in real-world scenarios. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures and propose two strategies to detect signal injection.},

A good social law prevents the agents from interfering with each other, but does not prevent them from achieving their goals. However, designing good social laws, or even checking whether a proposed social law is good, are hard questions. In this paper, we take a first step towards automating these processes, by formulating criteria for good social laws in a multi-agent planning framework. We then describe an automated technique for verifying if a proposed social law meets these criteria, based on a compilation to classical planning.},

	abstract = {Planning is an essential process in teams of multiple agents pursuing a common goal. When the effects of actions undertaken by agents are uncertain, evaluating the potential risk of such actions alongside their utility might lead to more rational decisions upon planning. This challenge has been recently tackled for single agent settings, yet domains with multiple agents that present diverse viewpoints towards risk still necessitate comprehensive decision making mechanisms that balance the utility and risk of actions. In this work, we propose a novel collaborative multi-agent planning framework that integrates (i) a team-level online planner under uncertainty that extends the classical {UCT} approximate algorithm, and (ii) a preference modeling and multicriteria group decision making approach that allows agents to ﬁnd accepted and rational solutions for planning problems, predicated on the attitude each agent adopts towards risk. When utilised in risk-pervaded scenarios, the proposed framework can reduce the cost of reaching the common goal sought and increase effectiveness, before making collective decisions by appropriately balancing risk and utility of actions.},

	abstract = {In online contingent planning under partial observability an agent decides at each time step on the next action to execute, given its initial knowledge of the world, the actions executed so far, and the observation made. Such agents require some representation of their belief state to determine which actions are valid, or whether the goal has been achieved. Efficient maintenance of a belief state is, given its potential exponential size, a key research challenge in this area. In this paper we develop the theory of regression as a useful tool for belief-state maintenance. We provide a formal description of regression, discussing various alternatives and optimization techniques, and analyze its space and time complexity. In particular, we show that, with some care, the regressed formula will contain variables relevant to the current query only, rather than all variables in the problem description. Consequently, under suitable assumptions, the complexity of regression queries is at most exponential in its contextual width. This parameter is always upper bounded by Bonet and Geffner's width parameter, introduced in their state-of-the-art factored belief tracking ({FBT}) method. In addition, we show how to obtain a poly-sized circuit representation for the online regression formula even with non-deterministic actions. We provide an empirical comparison of regression with {FBT}-based belief maintenance, showing the power of regression for online belief tracking. We also suggest caching techniques for regression, and demonstrate their value in reducing runtime in current benchmarks.},

	abstract = {In contingent planning problems, agents have partial information about their state and use sensing actions to learn the value of some variables. When sensing and actuation are separated, plans for such problems can often be viewed as a tree of sensing actions, separated by conformant plans consisting of non-sensing actions that enable the execution of the next sensing action. This leads us to propose a heuristic, online method for contingent planning which focuses on identifying the next useful sensing action. The key part of our planner is a novel landmarks-based heuristic for selecting the next sensing action, together with a projection method that uses classical planning to solve the intermediate conformant planning problems. This allows our planner to operate without an explicit model of belief space or the use of existing translation techniques, both of which can require exponential space. The resulting Heuristic Contingent Planner ({HCP}) solves many more problems than state-of-the-art, translation-based online contingent planners, and in most cases much faster.},
